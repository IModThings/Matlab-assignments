Matlab Image Processing:
  Utilizing the Image add-on various images taken by the Hubble space telescope were analyzed to obtain a rough estimate of the number of visually distinguishable stellar objects in three images of star clusters. Procured data in the form of x-axis and y-axis coordinates along with an estimate of each stars relative size as presented in the source image measured in pixels. This data was visualized in the form of plotted markers both overlaid upon the source image and with graphs.

  Visual spectroscopy was also attempted, with the goal of identifying the presence of significant elements which make up large parts of the composition of various nebula. This data was compared to an identical NASA analyses to compare results.
